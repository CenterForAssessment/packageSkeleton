The packageSkeleton GitHub repository is a comprehensive template to jump-start the development of an R package, complete with a structured framework for coding, documentation, and version control. The package simplifies the process of setting up an R package repository on GitHub, offering built-in integration with Quarto for generating a professional, customizable website to showcase package documentation and and other content derived from the package.

The repo is designed to help both new and experienced R developers streamline package creation while ensuring best practices in documentation and collaboration. With minimal setup, users can focus on building and sharing valuable tools within the R ecosystem.
