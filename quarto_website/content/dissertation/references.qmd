<!-- 
This chapter will automatically generate the reference list based on:
1. The bibliography file specified in _quarto.yml (assets/bibliography/references.bib)
2. Citations used throughout the dissertation chapters
3. The CSL style file for formatting (assets/bibliography/apa.csl)

The references will be automatically formatted and inserted here when the document is rendered.
No manual entry of references is needed - just cite sources using [@key] format in your chapters.
