This guide will walk you through the necessary steps for getting started, including installing required software, setting up your GitHub account, forking the repository, and customizing both the R package and the website.\n\n\n\nBefore using packageSkeleton, you need to have the following tools installed on your computer, and you’ll need a GitHub account to manage your project.\n\n\n\nR: Ensure that you have the latest version of R installed. You can download it from CRAN.\nRStudio (Optional but Recommended): RStudio is a popular IDE for working with R. It simplifies the development process and integrates well with GitHub and Quarto.\nQuarto: Quarto is used to build the website associated with your R package. Install Quarto by following the instructions on Quarto’s website.\n\nOn macOS:\nbrew install quarto\nOn Windows: Download and run the installer from Quarto’s download page.\n\nGit: Install Git, which will allow you to interact with GitHub and version control your project.\n\nOn macOS:\nbrew install git\nOn Windows: Download and install Git for Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need a GitHub account to manage your project repository and host the website. If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, sign up for free here.\n\n\n\nGo to the packageSkeleton GitHub repository.\nClick the “Fork” button in the top-right corner to create a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.\nOnce forked, you will have your own version of packageSkeleton to work with.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve forked the repo, clone it to your local machine using Git. In RStudio, you can do this by going to File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. Alternatively, use the command line:\ngit clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/packageSkeleton.git\ncd packageSkeleton\nThis will download the repository to your computer, where you can start making changes.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have the project on your machine, it’s time to customize the R package.\n\n\nBy default, the package is called packageSkeleton. To personalize it:\n\nOpen the DESCRIPTION file.\nChange the Package field to your desired package name:\n\nPackage: MyPackageName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the R/ directory, add your own R scripts that define the functions you want to include in your package.\nEach R script should follow the convention of documenting the functions using roxygen comments. For example:\n\n# A Sample Function\nsample_function &lt;- function(x) {\n  x^2\n}\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve added your custom functions, it’s important to build and test the package. You can do this in RStudio or via the command line:\ndevtools::build()\ndevtools::check()\n\n\n\n\nYour packageSkeleton project comes with a Quarto-based website that documents your package. Let’s walk through customizing it.\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file in the project. This file controls the structure and appearance of the website.\n\nUpdate the title, author, and repo-url fields to match your package details.\n\nproject:\n  type: website\ntitle: \"MyPackageName\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\nrepo-url: \"https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/MyCustomPackage\"\n\n\n\nYou can edit the content of the website by modifying the .qmd files located in the root directory.\n\nindex.qmd: This is the homepage of your Quarto site.\ngetting_started.qmd: This file can serve as a guide for users getting started with your package (like the one you’re reading now).\nreference.qmd: This file provides a function reference for your package.\n\n\n\n\nTo build the website and preview it locally, run the following commands in your terminal or RStudio console:\nquarto render\nquarto preview\nThis will render the documents and start a local server where you can view the site. Any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the browser.\n\n\n\nOnce you’re happy with your customizations, you can publish the website on GitHub Pages. If you’ve forked the packageSkeleton repo, GitHub Pages will be set up to build from the docs/ folder. Simply push your changes to GitHub, and the site will be automatically updated.\n\n\n\n\nAs the original packageSkeleton repo might get updates, it’s good practice to keep your fork in sync. You can do this by fetching and merging changes from the original repository:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/packageSkeleton.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/main\nThis will pull in the latest changes from the upstream repo.\n\n\n\nYou’re now ready to start building your own R package with an integrated Quarto website. Follow the steps above to customize the package, document your functions, and share your work with others through GitHub and GitHub Pages. If you run into any issues, check out the vignette for more detailed instructions.\nHappy coding!"

If `n_char` is positive, it returns the first `n_char` characters; if negative, it returns all but the last `abs(n_char)` characters. The function handles input validation, ensuring that `n_char` is within the bounds of the string length. It's useful for quickly trimming strings to desired lengths.\n\n## Usage\n\n``````r\nstrHead(\n    string,\n    n_char=1)\n``````\n\n## Arguments\n\n* `string`: Character string or vector of character strings.\n* `n_char`: Number of characters to take from the head (starting at the first character) of the string (or vector of strings). A positive value returns the first `n_char` characters, while a negative value removes the last `abs(n_char)` characters from the end. Defaults to 1.\n\n## Keyword\n\nmisc\n\n## Keyword\n\nmodels\n\n## Details\n\nThe `strHead` function is typically used to extract the first few characters from a character string or each string in a vector of character strings. This can be useful for truncating strings or extracting prefixes. The function supports both positive and negative values for `n_char`, allowing flexible string extraction. For positive values, the function returns the first `n_char` characters, while for negative values, it returns all but the last `abs(n_char)` characters.\n\n## Author\n\nDamian W. Betebenner [dbetebenner@nciea.org](mailto:dbetebenner@nciea.org)\n\n## Value\n\nThe function returns a character string or a vector of character strings, depending on the input. The output consists of the first `n_char` characters from each string in the input. If `n_char` is negative, the result excludes the last `abs(n_char)` characters from each string.\n\n## Examples\n\n``````r\n# Example 1: First two characters of each state name\nstrHead(state.name, 2)\n\n# Example 2: First three characters of a single string\nstrHead(\"California\", 3)\n\n# Example 3: Remove the last two characters from each string in a vector\nstrHead(c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"), -2)\n\n# Example 4: Get the first character of each month name\nstrHead(month.name, 1)\n\n# Example 5: Handle a vector of different length strings\nstrHead(c(\"wolf\", \"elephant\", \"giraffe\"), 4)\n``````\n\n# `strTail`: Returns the last `n` characters of a string, with support for negative values.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `strTail` function extracts the last `n` characters of a provided string. If `n_char` is positive, it returns the last `n_char` characters; if negative, it returns all but the first `abs(n_char)` characters. The function handles input validation, ensuring that `n_char` is within the bounds of the string length. It's useful for quickly trimming strings to desired lengths.\n\n## Usage\n\n``````r\nstrTail(\n    string,\n    n_char=1)\n``````\n\n## Arguments\n\n* `string`: Character string or vector of character strings.\n* `n_char`: Number of characters to take from the tail (starting at the last character) of the string (or vector of strings). A positive value returns the last `n_char` characters, while a negative value removes the first `abs(n_char)` characters from the start. Defaults to 1.\n\n## Keyword\n\nmisc\n\n## Keyword\n\nmodels\n\n## Details\n\nThe `strTail` function is commonly used to extract the last few characters from a character string or each string in a vector of character strings. This is helpful when you need to retrieve suffixes or the end portion of strings. The function supports both positive and negative values for `n_char`. For positive values, the function returns the last `n_char` characters, while for negative values, it excludes the first `abs(n_char)` characters from the start of each string.\n\n## Author\n\nDamian W.
