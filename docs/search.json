This is a normal SGP.\nTwo year’s growth (in one year) is calculated empirically by running individual data spanning two years (e.g. grade 3 to 5 data) through one-year growth norms (e.g., grade 3 to 4 growth norms).\nThree year’s growth (in one year) is calculated empirically by running individual data spanning three years (e.g. grade 3 to 6 data) through one-year growth norms (e.g., grade 3 to 4 growth norms).\nNo growth (in one year) is calculated by running individual data with no increase in scaled score through the one-year growth norms (e.g., grade 3 to 4 growth norms).\nI also calculated half-year growth (in one year) by running individual data spanning a single year (e.g., grade 3 to 4 data) through two-year growth norms(e.g., grade 3 to 5 growth norms).\n\nResults are summarized in the following figures."
