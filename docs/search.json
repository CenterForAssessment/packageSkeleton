By consolidating functions, data sets, and workflows you use regularly into a package, you streamline your own work. Additionally, your solutions may end up being valuable to others who work in similar domains.\nThis package skeleton encourages that mindset, helping you create something that is immediately useful in your own workflow while also providing a structure for sharing your work with the broader R community."

Betebenner [DBetebenner@nciea.org](mailto:DBetebenner@nciea.org)\n\n# `strHead`: Returns the first `n` characters of a string, with support for negative values.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `strHead` function extracts the first `n` characters of a provided string. If `n_char` is positive, it returns the first `n_char` characters; if negative, it returns all but the last `abs(n_char)` characters. The function handles input validation, ensuring that `n_char` is within the bounds of the string length. It's useful for quickly trimming strings to desired lengths.\n\n## Usage\n\n``````r\nstrHead(\n    string,\n    n_char=1)\n``````\n\n## Arguments\n\n* `string`: Character string or vector of character strings.\n* `n_char`: Number of characters to take from the head (starting at the first character) of the string (or vector of strings). A positive value returns the first `n_char` characters, while a negative value removes the last `abs(n_char)` characters from the end. Defaults to 1.\n\n## Keyword\n\nmisc\n\n## Keyword\n\nmodels\n\n## Details\n\nThe `strHead` function is typically used to extract the first few characters from a character string or each string in a vector of character strings. This can be useful for truncating strings or extracting prefixes. The function supports both positive and negative values for `n_char`, allowing flexible string extraction. For positive values, the function returns the first `n_char` characters, while for negative values, it returns all but the last `abs(n_char)` characters.\n\n## Author\n\nDamian W. Betebenner [dbetebenner@nciea.org](mailto:dbetebenner@nciea.org)\n\n## Value\n\nThe function returns a character string or a vector of character strings, depending on the input. The output consists of the first `n_char` characters from each string in the input. If `n_char` is negative, the result excludes the last `abs(n_char)` characters from each string.\n\n## Examples\n\n``````r\n# Example 1: First two characters of each state name\nstrHead(state.name, 2)\n\n# Example 2: First three characters of a single string\nstrHead(\"California\", 3)\n\n# Example 3: Remove the last two characters from each string in a vector\nstrHead(c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"), -2)\n\n# Example 4: Get the first character of each month name\nstrHead(month.name, 1)\n\n# Example 5: Handle a vector of different length strings\nstrHead(c(\"wolf\", \"elephant\", \"giraffe\"), 4)\n``````\n\n# `strTail`: Returns the last `n` characters of a string, with support for negative values.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `strTail` function extracts the last `n` characters of a provided string. If `n_char` is positive, it returns the last `n_char` characters; if negative, it returns all but the first `abs(n_char)` characters. The function handles input validation, ensuring that `n_char` is within the bounds of the string length. It's useful for quickly trimming strings to desired lengths.\n\n## Usage\n\n``````r\nstrTail(\n    string,\n    n_char=1)\n``````\n\n## Arguments\n\n* `string`: Character string or vector of character strings.\n* `n_char`: Number of characters to take from the tail (starting at the last character) of the string (or vector of strings). A positive value returns the last `n_char` characters, while a negative value removes the first `abs(n_char)` characters from the start. Defaults to 1.\n\n## Keyword\n\nmisc\n\n## Keyword\n\nmodels\n\n## Details\n\nThe `strTail` function is commonly used to extract the last few characters from a character string or each string in a vector of character strings. This is helpful when you need to retrieve suffixes or the end portion of strings. The function supports both positive and negative values for `n_char`. For positive values, the function returns the last `n_char` characters, while for negative values, it excludes the first `abs(n_char)` characters from the start of each string.\n\n## Author\n\nDamian W.
